# You are given an integer array nums and an integer val. Your task is to remove all occurrences of val from nums in-place.

# After removing all occurrences of val, return the number of remaining elements, say k, such that the first k elements of nums do not contain val.


# Note:

# The order of the elements which are not equal to val does not matter.
# It is not necessary to consider elements beyond the first k positions of the array.
# To be accepted, the first k elements of nums must contain only elements not equal to val.
# Return k as the final result.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,4], val = 1

# Output: [2,3,4]


nums = [1,1,2,3,4]
val = 1
k=0
for x in nums:
    if x != val:
        nums[k]=x
        k+=1
print(nums[:k])

# class Solution:
#     def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
#         k=0
#         for i in range(len(nums)):
#             if nums[i] != val:
#                 nums[k] = nums[i]
#                 k+=1
#         return k
